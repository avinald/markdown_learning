## What is a Markup Language ?

Markup language is a text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols inserted in a text document\
to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship between its parts. Markup is often used to\
control the display of the document or to enrich its content to facilitating automated processing.

## What about Markdown ?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a\
plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as\
a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.\
Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative\
software, documentation pages, and readme files.

### So what exactly can I do with it ?

# YOU can make a BIG heading like this one
## A smaller heading like this one
### A tiny heading like this
#### Or go ever smaller ...

You can write a normal paragraph but with few letters in **bold** and few in *italics*.


You can also have a ***bold italic***
<!-- Add comments which you cannot see -->

As this is Github we can even add ~~ strikethrough !~~

Few Markdown flavours support additional features such as :

### A Table

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

### A Tablw with justification

| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |
| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |

### A To-do list

- [x] Write the press release
- [ ] Update the website
- [ ] Contact the media

### and my favourite ... syntax highlighting in code block

```js
var add2 = function(number) {
	return number + 2;
}
```

```python
a, b = 0, 1
while b < 10:
    print(b)
    a, b = a, a + b
```
